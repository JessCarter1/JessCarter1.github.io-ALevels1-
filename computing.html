<h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
<div>
  <p>The Computer Science A Level course focuses has two elements- theory and practical programming. </p>
  <p>The theory element focuses on how a computer works, its architecture and the uses and implications of this.</p>
  <p>The programming aspect focuses on the concepts, such as iteration and selection, of programming as well as creating code which will execute a given task. It also involves modifying pre-existing code. For this yearâ€™s AS exam, the skeleton code is a program which converts text into Morse Code and in class I have been adding code to allow the program to save the code to a file and allow the code to be encrypted among other modifications.</p>
